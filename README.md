heya i am wolfplay013. the person who plays rhythm doctor and stuff. i am a beginner programmer who learns python and C# to mod rhythm doctor i guess..
the rd mod isn't available yet. but there are some stuff planned like
- some retexturing stuff
- a surgery mod (everything trough surgery will become available in the rd editor)
- a Shift+B (mod bypass) feature to get the vanilla rhythm doctor without removing the mod from the steam file.
& more i guess..

You can find me trough discord (WolfPlay013#7193) twitter (https://twitter.com/WolfPlay_Posts / @WolfPlay_Posts). I am mostly active there

See ya!
